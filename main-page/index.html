    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello!, I am a future Front-end Developer that is currently learning the skills at DCI (Digital Career   Institute School, Berlin).
        Previously, I studied for 3 years dual-training in a **** Hotel, Hospitality/Turism degree. During this period, I could improve my customer care skills, marketing strategy, account management and PC tools like Microsoft Word and Opera Hotel PMS Systems Software.
        After more than 10 years working experience, all of them working in team and with customer, I have learned how to develop my emotional intelligence, handle pressure situations, helping others and the ability to adapt to new enviroments and challenges, as well as quick problem solving throug logical, rational solutions. I can contribute strong work ethic and motivation.
